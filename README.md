# UPM Master's in Data Science: Machine Learning project

Machine Learning project using probabilistic and non-probabilistic models, unsupervised learning and probabilistic graphical models for classification of poverty.

## Non-probabilistic models
The non-probabilistic models used on this projects are the following:
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Rule Induction
* Classification Trees
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## Probabilistic models
The probabilistic models used on this project are:
* Logistic Regression
* Bayesian Models
* Discriminant Analysis
