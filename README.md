# UPM Master's in Data Science: Machine Learning project

Machine Learning project using non-probabilistic models for classification of people dedicated to unpaid domestic work

## Non-probabilistic models
The non-probabilistic models used on this projects are the following:
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Rule Induction
* Classification Trees
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

All of these models were applied using Weka software.
